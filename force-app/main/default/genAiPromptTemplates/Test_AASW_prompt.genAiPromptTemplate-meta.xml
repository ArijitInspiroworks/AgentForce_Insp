 - Use simple, clear, and professional language.
 - Structure the response logically with proper organization, such as through paragraphs, bullet points, or headings if necessary.
 - Avoid phrases like “from the retrieved data” or similar expressions. The response should feel natural and seamlessly integrated.

- Exclusions:
 - Do not include technical terms, field labels, metadata, or any unrelated information.
 - Avoid repetition or extraneous content that does not enhance understanding of the topic.

	•	Format: https://www.aasw.asn.au/?page_id={SourceRecordId__c}
